At-FSM([@ Finite State Machine](https://github.com/At-EC/At-FSM)) is an open and user-friendly embedded Finite State Machine(FSM) designed for various embedded controllers' supporting, as it's beginning it will be an important member of the At-EC family.

The goal of the system is to explore and try to provide a range of features and capabilities to support and simplify your embedded firmware implementation.

We hope the At-EC will be a popular community-based embedded controller's project in the future. If this project was useful to you, give it a ‚≠ê. It is very important for us to know it is useful to you and your attention will encourage us.
